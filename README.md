Fantast Characters Storyboard!

Welcome to the fantasy characters storyboard. This is a public access app where any user can, view and create different fantasy races to build a database of characters within those races for themselves and for other users to view for storyboarding purposes-- whether it be for DnD, writing, gaming, etc. all characters entered into the database are claimable by any user for their own putposes. This tool is used to share creative inspiration for fantasy creators.

Installation To install this program, clone the repository from https://github.com/jcmcarth06/dnd-frontend, then run 'bundle install' in the terminal.

The user does not have to create a profile to use this app. There are no saved sessions or logouts-- all free, open access. If a user wishes to add a race to the database, they can do so useing the create race button-- otherwise they can select from an already existing set of races. Once inside of a certain race, the user can view all of the existing characters and select one to view their individual attributes. If the user likes the charater and wants to claim them for their own use, they can print off the information and then claim (delete) the charater from the system so it is not used by other people. If the user would like to create a new character, they simply select or create the character's race, then select the create character button. This will promt a view that contains all of the cusomizable attributes for that character, along with some prompts for those attributes. Once the user is satisfied, they can add their character to the database, making it free and available for anyone to view, use, and claim.
